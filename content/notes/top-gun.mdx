When the US Navy suffered excessive losses in air combat over Vietnam,
they set up the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor
program, popularly known as TOPGUN.

Pilots had had poor manoeuvring skills due to limited practice in
real-world combat situations. Getting pilots to practice in more real
dog fights to gain practice was obviously not a solution. To solve
this, TOPGUN set up mock dogfights which resembled real ones as
closely as possible and saw tremendous returns.

In knowledge work, it is often hard to replicate the real-world
situations you will face in your job. However, it is often possible to
set up practice situations which resemble the job as closely as
possible.
