Going fast has unappreciated benefits.

- Speed gets you where you want quicker (obvious).
- Speed not only allows you to complete the same activities faster,
  but also unlocks completely new activities. For example, faster
  typing unlocks the ability to take a transcript rather than bullet
  point notes.
- Speed increases learning by passing through more feedback loops.
- Speed shorterns backlogs. When you do things quicker, you avoid the
  overhead that comes from having to postpone tasks until later. You
  can simply do them _now_.
