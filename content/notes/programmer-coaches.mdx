Many disciplines, most notably sport and music, have fairly
standardised forms coaching. Yet in knowledge work, where one would
assume the financial incentives are strong, coaching is absent.

Given that hiring is so expensive, there are lots of viable paths to
getting better, why don't we have coaches for programming?

### Theories as to why this might not be the case

- Perhaps programming is not as technical and assessable as music and
  sports?
- Do managers cover this role already?
- Does pair programming cover this role already?
- Good coaches are likely to be good programmers and therefore to have
  many other lucrative opportunities available to them. The same
  cannot be said for musicians and older athletes.

### Avenues to explore

- Persue filming myself coding more
- Try hiring a coach
- Try coaching others
- Speak to other programmers, particularly managers
- What have people tried here already? e.g. What has Kent Becks'
  experience at Facebook been like? (source:
