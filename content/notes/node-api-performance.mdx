The followingÂ middleware works well as a lightweight method for logging the performance of [Express](https://expressjs.com/) API endpoints to the console.

Use it when you want to quickly monitor and improve your backend's performance.

```javascript
const logPerformance = (req, res, next) => {
    const startInMs = performance.now()

    res.on('finish', function () {
        const endInMs = performance.now()
        const elapsed = endInMs - startInMs
        console.log('url: ', req.url)
        console.log('time: ', elapsed + 'ms')
    })

    next()
}

// ...
app.all('*', logPerformance) // disable for production```
