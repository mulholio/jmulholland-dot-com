title: 'Thoughts'
---

Here you can find a collection of my interests and beliefs. On the
semi-anonymous internet, it's a way I can tell you a bit about myself.

I also track this page in
[git](https://github.com/mulholio/jmulholland-dot-com/) so that I have
a log of how these evolve over time.

## Interests

### Programming

Learning to code is the best example I know of a positive feedback
loop: the more you learn, the more you want to learn. It is my
favourite method for obtaining
[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow) and
is one of the most consistent tools I have for lifting my mood. I like
getting better at all aspects of software development, whether that's
learning new languages (currently Haskell), new technologies (React is
my favourite), [Vim](https://vim.org) (yes, you should learn it) or my
typing speed (currently 62wpm on [typing.io](https://typing.io)).

### Design

As well as in a professional capacity whilst working on the front end
of websites, I have an interest in design more generally. I have a
tendency to see a lot of life as a design problem that can be solved.
Mostly, however, this simply involves getting angry about
[Norman Doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI) and poorly
designed cycle lanes. My favourite designs are the
[Finnish drying rack/cupboard hybrid](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/finnish-dishes-simple-nordic-design-beats-dishwashers-drying-racks/)
and [Dieter Rams' 606 Shelving Unit](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/606).

### Philosophy

I studied philosophy at university and I think of it as a fantastic
lens through which you can view everything else in life. It is a
foundation that prompts you to examine first principles and its
methodology of precise examination feels infinitely applicable. There
are instances where it is specifically and pragmatically useful (e.g.
[truth-tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table) making
programming logic easier) and also when it helps improve broader
skills (e.g. in the ability to construct a well-formed argument).

### Effective Altruism

Tangental to Philosophy, I am keenly interested in the
[Effective Alturism](https://effectivealtruism.org) movement (perhaps
more as a mode of thinking than a community). If you haven't heard of
EA, this
[article](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/),
this
[talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/will_macaskill_how_can_we_do_the_most_good_for_the_world?language=en)
or this
[book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105)
are good places to start. If you're more interested in making an
impact through your career, make sure to check out
[80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/).

### Meta-learning and Productivity

When I began to learn to code while simultaneously studying for my
degree, I became increasingly interested in meta-learning (learning
how to learn) and its power to exponentially boost all other skills. I
am also continuously refining my productivity systems and am a big fan
of [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/),
[PARA](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/),
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and
[pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). These
are areas I am constantly working and I always seek new ways of
improving focus, knowledge retention and skill-acquisition.

### Art

Art is an area of my life that is infinitely valuable yet seems
neglected in many tech circles. Here's a list of some of my favourite
art forms and artists. Please send me any of your favourites as I find
this the best way to discover new things I like!

  varied (Spotify

## Beliefs

I find the act of explicitly articulating your beliefs clarifies them
and separates the important from the trivial. This list is an ongoing
attempt to do that.

- Politics is an ineffective vehicle for change for 80% of people. Of
  course, _some_ people should be interested in politics but for most
  it serves only as a talking point on which action is never taken.
- You should probably block news content. You're better off consuming
  older information like books that contain higher quality information
  and will be useful for a longer period of time. Of course, if
  something is truly important news, you'll probably hear about it
  anyway.
- You should aim to be more
  [anti-fragile](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225).
- [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow)
  is the biggest determinant of enjoyment and meaning at work and it
  is, therefore, a moral imperative to maximise its occurrence.
- Creativity is not as magical as it's made out to be and there is no
  reason why much of what humans do that is 'artistic' cannot be done
  by a machine.
- Most of your impact on the world is in the long-term future and this
  has a profound impact on the decisions you make.
- It is useful to remember your own mortality.
- Decision theory is (almost?) always a waste of time.
- ~~Free will is an illusion.~~ I am a compatabilist about free will.
- ~~Utilitarianism is a very good heuristic for living your life by.
  I'm not completely sure on its foundations, however.~~ I am
  currently less sure on even this belief. Currently under
  investigation so if you have any good meta-ethics/moral
  foundations/moral disagrement recommendations, please email me!
