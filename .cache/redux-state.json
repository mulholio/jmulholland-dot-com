      "body": "Here you can find a collection of my interests and beliefs. On the semi-anonymous internet, it's a way I can tell you a bit about myself.\n\n## Interests\n\nThese are things that I am currently interested in, reading about or working on. I try to focus on what is on this list and exclude anything that is not.\n\n**Design Systems and the Fusion of Design and Development**\n\nSince becoming a front-end developer, I have been fascinated by two recurring problems in my work.\n\nFirstly, there is the issue of bridging the gap between design and code. Although lots of work is being done in this area, for the time being, I still feel there is too much of a chasm between pixels and code. I am interested in tools and methodologies which let designers deliver more useful deliverables to developers (i.e. code rather than images) and which let developers appreciate more fully the oft-undervalued world of design.\n\nThe second problem is scaling design. I am interested in making good design more maintainable and easier to implement. I see design systems as tools to abstract what makes a product aesthetic and usable.\n\n**Programming**\n\nLearning to code is the best example I know of a positive feedback loop: the more you learn, the more you want to learn. It is my favourite method for obtaining [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow) and is one of the most consistent tools I have for lifting my mood.\n\nCurrently, I am interested in nailing the [last 20%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) of JavaScript and React. I am always looking to explore new CSS and HTML techniques and share a few examples from my [newsletter](https://www.copythat.io/) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/mulholio/#).
