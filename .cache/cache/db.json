On the semi-anonymous internet, it's a way I can tell you a bit about myself.</p>\n<h2>Interests</h2>\n<p>These are things that I am currently interested in, reading about or working on. I try to focus on what is on this list and exclude anything that is not.</p>\n<p><strong>Design Systems and the Fusion of Design and Development</strong></p>\n<p>Since becoming a front-end developer, I have been fascinated by two recurring problems in my work.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there is the issue of bridging the gap between design and code. Although lots of work is being done in this area, for the time being, I still feel there is too much of a chasm between pixels and code. I am interested in tools and methodologies which let designers deliver more useful deliverables to developers (i.e. code rather than images) and which let developers appreciate more fully the oft-undervalued world of design.</p>\n<p>The second problem is scaling design. I am interested in making good design more maintainable and easier to implement. I see design systems as tools to abstract what makes a product aesthetic and usable.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>\n<p>Learning to code is the best example I know of a positive feedback loop: the more you learn, the more you want to learn. It is my favourite method for obtaining <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow\">flow</a> and is one of the most consistent tools I have for lifting my mood.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am interested in nailing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">last 20%</a> of JavaScript and React. I am always looking to explore new CSS and HTML techniques and share a few examples from my <a href=\"https://www.copythat.io/\">newsletter</a> on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/mulholio/#\">CodePen</a>. For other projects, head over to my <a href=\"https://github.com/mulholio\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>I studied philosophy at university and I think of it as a fantastic lens through which you can view everything else in life. It is a foundation that prompts you to examine first principles, not surface-level truths and its methodology of precise examination feels infinitely applicable.</p>\n<p>There are instances where it is specifically and pragmatically useful (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table\">truth-tables</a> making more complex uses of Javascript's ternary operator a breeze) and also when it helps improve broader skills (e.g. in the ability to construct a well-formed argument).</p>\n<p>I am also still holding out that, despite still struggling to find a real-world application, decision theory might one day be useful to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Meta-learning and Productivity</strong></p>\n<p>When I began to learn to code while simultaneously studying for my degree, I became increasingly interested in meta-learning (learning how to learn) and its power to exponentially boost all other skills. It is an area I am constantly working and I always seek new ways of improving focus, knowledge retention and skill-acquisition.</p>\n<p><strong>Street Photography</strong></p>\n<p>My primary form of consuming and creating art is through street photography. It is a niche discipline that far too few people know about and I love its emphasis of content above and beyond mere aesthetics.</p>\n<p>I'm working on a proper place to showcase the photos I am happy with but for now, you can check out my poorly-updated <a href=\"https://vsco.co/mulholio/\">VSCO</a>.</p>\n<h2>Future Interests</h2>\n<p>These are things I would like to learn more about in the coming months and years but that I don't feel knowledgeable enough about at the present moment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The automation of design and creativity</li>\n<li>AI</li>\n<li>Learning how to use <a href=\"https://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a></li>\n<li>Healthcare</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>I find the act of explicitly articulating your beliefs clarifies them and separates the important from the trivial.
